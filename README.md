## ğŸ“ˆ Visualizations

Data visualization is an important part of any data analysis project.  
It helps to understand the data better, find hidden patterns, and make the insights clear and easy to explain.

In this project, I created different types of charts using Matplotlib, such as:
- ğŸ“Š **Bar Charts** â€” for comparing values
- ğŸ“ˆ **Line Charts** â€” for showing trends
- ğŸŸ¡ **Scatter Plots** â€” for finding relationships between variables
- ğŸ“‰ **Histograms** â€” for understanding data distribution
- ğŸ§± **Box Plots** â€” for checking outliers and spread of the data

All the charts are saved.  
These visuals make the analysis more meaningful and give a better overview of the dataset.
